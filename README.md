### Todo
- [x] Reorganize & Rewrite backend, to properly modularize.
- [x] Commands & Buttons need to be combined into a "Interaction" folder.
- [x] Events/Interaction need to be moved to the above folder, as Manager.mjs (m.js standing for Manager JS, for Registry to read)
- [x] Utils needs to be turned into a folder, to properly modularize.
- [x] Off-Branch RP Features need to be separated.
- [ ] For Off-Branch RP, rewrite applications to create a channel when a new channel when a user joins, and talks to them, properly walking them threw the application in a conversational style.
